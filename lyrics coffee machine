[Verse]
The morning hum it sings to me
A soft rhythm like a melody
Drip drip goes the caffeine stream
Filling my cup filling my dream

[Chorus]
Coffee machine coffee machine
Wake me up like a waking scene
Your steam your song my quiet queen
Coffee machine coffee machine

[Verse 2]
Golden light on a ceramic stage
Liquid warmth turning my page
Every sip a story untold
Bitter sweet and pure as gold

[Chorus]
Coffee machine coffee machine
Wake me up like a waking scene
Your steam your song my quiet queen
Coffee machine coffee machine

[Outro]
Drip drip goes the caffeine stream
Coffee machine coffee machine
